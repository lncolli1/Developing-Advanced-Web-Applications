        <h3 class='text-navy'>Intro</h3>
        <p class='text-black'>
            If you're a fan of basketball and live in New Orleans, chances are 
			you've been more than frustrated at	the lack of success in recent 
			years from the New Orleans Pelicans. In the last 4 seasons the Pels have 
			managed to make the playoffs once. A lot of this team's lack of success 
			can be attributed to poor front office management. However, when looking 
			strictly at team talent, there is no reason why there shouldn't	be more 
			success to show for it. There's an underlying issue that has remained 
			constant in the last 5 seasons and I'm here to shine the light on the 
			problem... Alvin Gentry.

        <p class='text-black' >
            Alvin Gentry was hired as the Pelicans head coach in the summer of 2015. Monty Williams had just been
			fired as the head coach after successfully taking his team to the playoffs for the first time in 5 seasons.
			Dell Demps, the general manager at the time, felt that Monty wasn't showing enough success and decided to 
			move on and start fresh with a new head coach - Alvin Gentry. Looking at Gentry's resume there's really nothing
			that would have given you faith to believe that he was a worthy candidate for the job. With a record 335-370 there
			is no sensible answer as to why Dell Demps decided to hire a complete loser to lead the franchise that represents 
			our successful city.

        <p class='text-black'>
            Gentry has always been known as an offensive minded coach. He likes to play fast pace small ball and encourages his teams
			to shoot more 3-pointers than the league average. Each season that Alvin Gentry has been the head coach, the Pelicans have finished 
			in the top half of the league in offensive rating. If you've ever watched a Pelicans game, it's abundantly clear that offense is not 
			our problem... its defense. Defense wins championships, and Gentry has ZERO of those as a head coach. 
        </p>

        <h3 class='text-navy'>Part 3</h3>
        <p class='text-black'> 
            In each of his 5 season with the Pelicans, Gentry has only managed to have one season where our defensive rating wasn't in the bottom 
			10. A large part of his defensive struggles as a head coach come from his inability to understand matchups and when to substitute the 
			right player in the game.
        </p>

        <img class='center' src="images/image4.jpg">
        <h3 class='text-navy'>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class='text-black'>
             Its clear that Alvin Gentry has not been a good fit for the Pelicans and I think its time the front office move on. 
			 With Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram poised to have breakout seasons for the next several years, the Pelicans organization
			 must do everything it can to ensure that we escape mediocrity. To waste Zion's talent the same way that we did with Anthony Davis
			 would be a massive shame, and the only way to prevent that from happening is finding a new coach.
